  <p>I’m Adele Royal, a Graphic Designer based on the
    Gold Coast, Queensland. I’m a passionate designer
    with an appetite for good design and so I am
    always on the lookout for inspiration.
    Design has been a passion of mine ever since I can
    remember, and this is why I put 100% effort into every
    project I take on.<br> Having freelanced in photography
    and design for several years ,before then having completed
    a Diploma in Graphic Design and also a Certificate IV in
    Photo imaging. I do believe that I am fully equipped with
    the tools and the attitude to bring ideas to fruition.
    When I am not designing I am usually found sketching,
    painting or experimenting with digital art, watching Netflix
    or teaching my dog to fetch. The last one is still a work in progress.</p>
